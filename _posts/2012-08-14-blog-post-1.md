when I started hearing about Kotlin I thought it just a new language with new syntax so here are my steps :


I started by searching for how to convert java syntax to Koltin syntax cause I thought that the way I code is a constant by the language is a variable so when moving from language to another nothing change except the syntax and from here I started.
going to android-studio and from "code" menu choose "convert java file to kotlin file".

then I realized some keywords like (!! , ? , -> , object ) in my code and I didn't know what they are meaning.
here I moved one more step from just converting the code to know more about the syntax (just syntax) and I started from [Kotlin official doc](https://kotlinlang.org/docs).


reading and reading but I faced some terms I didn't know before like (null-safety, lambda expressions, closure, object, companion object, late-init ) what they are meaning??
and from here I decided to move on more step and watch the course of 
[Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers byGoogle](https://eg.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011)
and here my turning point . 


if you wanna write Koltin make sure you make use of :


1- [Extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html)


2- [Idioms](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/idioms.html#filtering-a-list)


3- [Null Safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html)


4- [Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html)


5- you may want to know more about classes and objects you should know  
about companion object, late init variables, data class.


and finally moving from Java to kotlin was not just about changing the syntax.
