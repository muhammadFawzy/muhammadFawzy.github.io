 Architecture is about intent!
 
 Let's say we have an android app with packages like this


![no architecture image](/images/no_architecture.png)

When I see these packages for the first time I recognize activity, fragment, model .. fantastic.
but here are some questions :

1. Why the directories of this application expose the framework? do I need to know it?!

2. why the high-level directory of this application doesn’t tell me what the application actually does?
### why the framework in front of me and hiding what’s the application supposed to do?!
 and here I realize that there is something wrong.

## So Why Clean Architecture?

when I see the clean architecture for the first time it impressed me. let's take a look what's actually does

![clean architecture image](/images/clean_architecture.jpg)

here we can see the main keys of clean architecture:

* Independent of Frameworks. The architecture does not depend on the existence of some library of feature-laden software. This allows you to use such frameworks as tools, rather than having to cram your system into their limited constraints.

* Once you have use-cases layer you can know what’s the application does without going to the framework. 

* The third key is the testability, The business rules can be tested without the framework and we can talk about testing later.


## Understanding Clean Architecture
 
 The code is divided into three separate layers:

1. The Presentation Layer
* This includes our Framework (ie: Activities, Fragments,...). An Activity should be as dumb as possible. Never put your business logic here in this layer.

2. The Domain Layer
* contains all the use cases of your application. In this example, we have a UseCase class that describes what's the business needs.
``` kotlin
class GetMenusUseCase {
    fun getAllMenus(pageNo: Int, menusRepository: MenusRepository = MenusRepository()) = menusRepository.getAllMenus(pageNo)
}
```

and here we solve our big problem **what's the application does** by looking to this class now we know what should this part of the app does without going to the framework.

3. The Data Layer
* This has all the repositories which the domain layer can use. This layer exposes a data source API to outside classes
``` kotlin
class MenusRepository : MenusDataSource {
    private val remoteDataSource by lazy { MenusRemoteDataSource() }

    override fun getAllMenus(pageNo: Int) = remoteDataSource.getAllMenus(pageNo)
}
```
``` kotlin
interface MenusDataSource {
    fun getAllMenus(pageNo: Int): Call<MenuList>
}
```

in this example, we can see the repository which responsible for getting the data from one or multiple data source by implementing a Datasource``` class.

> we notice **The Dependency Rule** of the clean architecture which is the most interesting thing,
> This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle.
