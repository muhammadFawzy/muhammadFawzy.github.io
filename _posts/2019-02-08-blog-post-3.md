### Architecture is about intent 
 Let's say we have an android app with packages like this


![no architecture image](/images/no_architecture.png)

When i see these packages for the first time i recognize  activity , fragment , model .. fantastic.
but here are some questions :
1 . Why the directories of this application expose the framework i use am i need to know the framework?
2 . why the high level directory of this application doesn’t tell me what the application actually does?
### why the framework in front of me and hiding what’s the application supposed to do ?!
 and here I realize that there is something wrong.

## so why clean Architecture?

when i see the clean architecture for the first time it impressed me. let's take a look what's actually does

![clean architecture image](/images/clean_architecture.jpg)

here we can see the main keys of clean architecture:

* Independent of Frameworks. The architecture does not depend on the existence of some library of feature laden software. This allows you to use such frameworks as tools, rather than having to cram your system into their limited constraints.

* Once you have use-cases layer you can know what’s the application does without going to the framework. 

* The third key is the testability, The business rules can be tested without the framework and we can talk about testing later.


## Understanding clean architecture
 
 The code is divided into three separate layers:

1 . The Presentation Layer
* This includes our Framework (ie: Activities, Fragments,...). An Activity should be as dumb as possible. Never put your business logic here in this layer.

2 . The Domain Layer
The domain layer
* contains all the use cases of your application. In this example, we have UseCase class that describe what's the business needs.
``` kotlin
class GetMenusUseCase {
    fun getAllMenus(pageNo: Int, menusRepository: MenusRepository = MenusRepository()) = menusRepository.getAllMenus(pageNo)
}
```

and here we solve our big problem **what's the application does** by looking to this class now we know what should this part of app does without going to the framework.

3 . The Data Layer
* This has all the repositories which the domain layer can use. This layer exposes a data source API to outside classes
``` kotlin
class MenusRepository : MenusDataSource {
    private val remoteDataSource by lazy { MenusRemoteDataSource() }

    override fun getAllMenus(pageNo: Int) = remoteDataSource.getAllMenus(pageNo)
}
```
``` kotlin
interface MenusDataSource {
    fun getAllMenus(pageNo: Int): Call<MenuList>
}
```

in this example we can see the repository which responsible for getting the data from one or multiple data source by implementing ```DataSource``` class.

> we notice **The Dependency Rule** of the clean architecture which is the most interesting thing,
> This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle.
