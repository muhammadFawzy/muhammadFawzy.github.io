The first time I heard about Kotlin I thought of it as a new language with a different syntax, but then I turned out to be wrong! 

Here’s how I started my journey in turning Java into Kotlin: 

At first, I started looking for a way to convert Java syntax to Kotlin as I thought the way I code is constant while language is a variable. So when moving from a language to another nothing will change except for the syntax, and as a result, I decided to convert Java to Kotlin from Android-Studio. Here is how it went: 
From the “Code” menu choose “Convert Java File to Kotlin File”.

Check FIGURE-1 below.

And then after the conversion, it came to my attention that my code had some keywords like  `!! , ? , -> , object ` which I didn’t know what they mean. 
Then I realized that converting wasn’t enough!. So I went further to know more about the syntax (just syntax) and I started from [Kotlin official doc](https://kotlinlang.org/docs).


I kept on reading, and reading, but I faced some terms that I haven’t seen before like (null-safety, lambda expressions, closure, object, companion object, late-init), and from here I decided to take a new step, and go further by watching this course named [Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers byGoogle](https://eg.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011)
and that was the turning point!.


If you want to start writing Kotlin instead of Java, and start a new challenge, then check the following: 


  1. [Extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html)


  2. [Idioms](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/idioms.html#filtering-a-list)


  3. [Null Safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html)


  4. [Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html)


Tip: you might need to know more about classes, objects, companion object, late init variables, and data class.

##### The conclusion is moving from Java to Kotlin wasn’t just about changing the syntax.
