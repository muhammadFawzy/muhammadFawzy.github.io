Android Engineer Geek who is very interested in [Clean Code](https://g.co/kgs/FQn1tv) & [Clean Architecture](https://g.co/kgs/AxPcTT).
I have worked on different types of projects educational, transportation and medical with a hands on experience with a wide variety of Android device resolutions and SDK versions. During these years I gained solid knowledge in the SDLC. Dedicated to continuously discovering, evaluating, and implementing new technologies to maximize development efficiency.


### Volunteering experience
======
I was a volunteer on Google Student Club (GSC) , inside IT Community and it was a very nice and useful experience.
I was a speaker about google advance search and how google search works (spider idea).
